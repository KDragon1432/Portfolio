      Python and Scratch are very similar in many aspects. They have similar commands. The largest difference would be the less cartoonish
      settings. It was significantly harder to code and I spent a lot of time debugging simple lines because of things like spaces and
      semi-colons.

      Today was fun, I didn't really finish, but it was fun to program. I kinda wish there was more time to finish everything. I was really 
      frustratec by the amount of simple SyntaxErrors that clogged up the time needed to code everything. It wasn't really significant in
      earlier projects when we planned out what we were going to do, but it is much more noticeable now. The planning and flow charts
      make it mush easier to organze my thought and keep on track.

      Data Strutures were very useful to use later on. Including lists, which are basically variables with multpile elements. they made
      organization easier. It was easy to work with my partners.
      I had a bit of difficulty with the pixis changes, but I got it in the end. That was very satisfying.
